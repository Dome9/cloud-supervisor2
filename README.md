# Overview
## What is this ?
Cloud-Supervisor 2 is an **automatic remediation solution for AWS** built on top of Dome9's Continuous Compliance capabilities

## Why and when would I need it ?
Dome9 Compliance Engine continuously scans the relevant cloud account (AWS,Azure,GCP) for policy violations, and then alert and report.<br/>
For some organizations that is enough. However, at a certain scale and cloud matureness level- organizations prefer to move towards automatic-remediation approach, in which the system takes specific automated remediation actions in regards to specific violations.</br>
This approach could reduce the load from the security operators and drastically reduce the time to resolve security issues.

## How does it work ?

### Single account mode:
![Data Flow](./pictures/data-flow.png?raw=true "Title")



### Multi account mode:
![Data Flow](./pictures/cs2_multi_acct_workflow.jpg?raw=true "Title")



- Dome9 will scan the accounts on an ongoing basis and send failing rules to SNS
- In the rules, if we want to add remediation, we can add in a "remediation flag" into the compliance section so that the SNS event is tagged with what we want to do. 
- Each remediation action that is tagged correlates to a file in the actions folder of the remediation function. 
- Lambda reads the message tags and looks for a tag that matches AUTO: <anything>
- If any of those AUTO tags match a remediation that we have built out, it'll call that action.
- All of the methods are sending their events to an array called text_output. Once the function is finished working, this array is turned into a string and posted to SNS


# Setup Steps

## Decide on deployment mode

### Single vs Multi

#### Single
In single account mode, the Lambda function will only remediate issues found within the account it's running in. If the event is from another account, it'll be skipped.

Setup for Single mode:
Skip down to 'Outside of Dome9'

#### Multi
In multi account mode, the function will run in the local account but will also try to assume a role into another account if the event was from a different account than the one the function is running in. Each account that will have remediation actions will need a cross-account role to the master account. 

Setup for Multi-account mode:
- Update deployment_cft.yaml (ACCOUNT_MODE: 'single') to 'multi'
- By default, the cross account roles will all need to be named "dome9-auto-remediations". If you want a different name, add a new line in deployment_cft.yaml under "Variables:" called "CROSS_ACCOUNT_ROLE_NAME:" and set the value to the new name for the role. 


## Outside of Dome9

### Clone this GitHub project
```bash 
git clone git@github.com:Dome9/cloud-supervisor2.git 
```

### Zip the function
```bash
cd cloud-supervisor2
zip -r -X remediation-function.zip actions/ handle_event.py index.py send_events_and_errors.py 
```

### Get the name of a S3 bucket to load the zip into
The zip will be automicatically uploaded to your S3 bucket before deployment. If you have an S3 bucket already, skip this step and put the bucket name in the command on the next step. 

If you need to create a new bucket:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://<NEW_BUCKET_NAME>
```

### Deploy the fucnction via CloudFormation template
For YOUR_BUCKET_NAME, put in the name of a bucket that remediation-function.zip can be uploaded to. 
```bash
aws cloudformation package    \
--template-file ./deployment_cft.yaml    \
--output-template-file serverless-output.yaml    \
--s3-bucket <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>

aws cloudformation deploy \
--template-file ./serverless-output.yaml \
--stack-name lambda-remediations \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

### Get the outputs from the new stack
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
--stack-name lambda-remediations \
--query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' \
--output text
```

The output will look like this:
```
ARN for the export logs topic   OutputTopicARN  arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:726853184812:remediationOutput
ARN that Dome9 sends events to  InputTopicARN   arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:726853184812:d9-findings
```
Save these ARNs for the next step and the Dome9 Continuous Compliance setup

### OPTIONAL: Set up a subscriber to the SNS output topic
Since the Lambda output is exported to SNS, you can send it from there to wherever you please. 

- If you want to send the events to Slack, please follow this guide: https://github.com/alpalwal/D9SnsToSlack

- To get email alerts instead, you can do it from the CLI:
```bash
aws sns subscribe \
--topic-arn <OUTPUT_TOPIC_ARN> \
--protocol email \
--notification-endpoint <your email>
```


### IF MULTI-ACCOUNT:

#### Set up cross account roles for each account that will be remediated

```bash
cd cross_account_role_configs
```

Role creation needs to be done via something other than CloudFormation because CFTs don't output consistent role names

#### Update trust_policy.json with the account ID where the main function will live

#### Create the cross-account role
```bash
aws iam create-role \
--role-name dome9-auto-remediations \
--assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json                    
```

#### Create the IAM policy for the role
```bash
aws iam create-policy \
--policy-name CloudSupervisorRemediations \
--policy-document file://remediation_policy.json \
--query 'Policy.Arn'
```

#### Link the new policy and role
Take ARN from create-policy for the next command           
```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy \
--role-name dome9-auto-remediations \
--policy-arn <ARN FROM LAST COMMAND>
```              





## In Dome9
See [this section](#in-dome9-1) for sample screenshots of the setup

### Create a bundle that you want to use for auto remediation. 
It's recommended but not required to break remediation actions into their own bundles. 
There is a sample bundle (sample_bundle.json) that can be used as a starting point.
The rule in the sample bundle will remove rules from the default security group if the SG is empty. 

### For all rules that you want to add remediation to, add the remediation tag to the "Compliance Section" of the rule. 

All available remediation actions are in the actions folder. 

#### Tag Syntax: AUTO: <action_name> <params>
    Ex: AUTO: ec2_stop_instance

### Test this compliance bundle. 
Make sure you're getting the results you want and expect

### Set the Dome9 compliance bundle to run via continuous compliance. 
If you're in single account mode, there needs to be a 1 Continuous Compliance bundle per account. If not, select all the accounts that you set up cross-account roles in. 
Set the output topic as the ARN from the InputTopicARN one we set up
Set the format to be JSON - Full Entity

If you have a subscriber set up for the remediationOutput topic, you'll see this message when you send the SNS test message during setup:
```
-------------------------
ReportTime: 2018-02-04T01:38:05.5899299+00:00
Error: This finding was found in account id 123456789123. The Lambda function is running in account id: 794306781643. Remediations need to be ran from the account there is the issue in.
-------------------------
```
This is alright and means that everything is working properly. 


### NOTE: 
Currently Continuous Compliance sends a 'diff' for the SNS notifications. Because of this, if you have ran the bundle before, only new issues will be sent to SNS. 
If you want to have the first auto-remediation run to include all pre-existing issues, you'll need to clone the bundle and set the new never-ran bundle as the thing that is being tested in the CC config. This works because if it's never ran, then every existing issue is considered 'new' and will be sent to SNS. 
This will be changed in future releases and is being currently worked on. 


### From here, you should be good to go!

# Adding new actions
Any new action that is added just needs to follow the format of the other actions and be put in the action folder. 

Here is a sample from sg_delete. The rule and entity variables that are passed through come from the source SNS message. Params are only passed through if there are any in the tag (ex: AUTO: ec2_tag_instance owner unknown)
```python
import boto3

def run_action(rule,entity,params):
    text_output = str(entity)
    region = entity['region']
    region = region.replace("_","-")
    sg_id = entity['id']
    
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name=region)
    result = ec2.SecurityGroup(sg_id).delete()

    responseCode = result['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode']
    if responseCode >= 400:
        text_output = "Unexpected error: %s \n" % str(result)
    else:
        text_output = "Security Group %s successfully deleted\n" % sg_id

    return text_output 
```
