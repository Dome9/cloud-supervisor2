'''
s3_enable_logging
What it does: Turns on server access logging
Usage: AUTO: s3_enable_logging 
Limitations: none
Requirements: 
    The target bucket needs to be in the same region as the remediation bucket or it'll throw a CrossLocationLoggingProhibitted error. 
    The target bucket must have write_object and read_bucket_permissions S3 logging ACLs or it'll throw a InvalidTargetBucketForLogging error.
    This will check for a bucket called <accountNumber>S3accesslogs<region> and create one if it doesn't exist.
